suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding error handling within the `rag_answer` function to gracefully manage potential issues during document retrieval or chain invocation.
- Implement LangSmith tracing to monitor and debug the agent's performance, as suggested by the chapter content.
- Add input validation to the `run_agent` function to handle cases where the query is empty or invalid.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding error handling for network requests within the tools.
- The code could benefit from more comments, especially explaining the purpose of each component in the RAG and agent pipelines.

suggestions for improvement:
- This submission is a `requirements.txt` file. It lists Python packages, not code that implements the agentic RAG application or interacts with a tool-using agent as required by the prompt.
- Ensure that `app.py` adheres to streamlit best practices for maintaining a responsive user interface and preventing long processing times from blocking the main thread.
- Consider using `st.cache_data` or `st.cache_resource` to cache expensive operations, such as loading models or initializing vector stores.
