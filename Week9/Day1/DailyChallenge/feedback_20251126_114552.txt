suggestions for improvement:
- This file defines configuration settings but doesn't implement any of the API endpoints or CLI client specified in the problem description. Therefore, it only addresses a small part of the overall requirements.
- Consider using a more robust method for managing environment variables, such as a library that supports .env files with defaults and validation.
